## Decision

We will use https://github.com/cabbage-ex/cabbage


## Reasoning

I have looked through three candidates:

1. https://github.com/cabbage-ex/cabbage
2. https://github.com/meadsteve/white-bread
3. https://github.com/antonmi/espec

The second one is quite complex in the terms of API.
The third one does not support `gherkin`.
